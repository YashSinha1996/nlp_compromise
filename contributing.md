###Welcome, good person

NLP is a solvable problem at scale, and all forms of input are gracious and lovely. We're very friendly and approachable. There is lots of work to be done.

* unit tests are run with `npm test`
* `npm run build` command joins all various scripts into a static js file

### Extending nlp\_compromise with Plugins/Mixins
see [Documentation](./plugins.md)

### Building
needs an ES6 env, like `nvm use 4`
```
npm install
npm run build or npm run build_windows
npm run watch
npm run docs
```

`npm run demo` or `npm run demo_windows`
and visit http://localhost:8080/

### Releasing
casual versioning/publishing as semver, Major is breaking, minor is improving.

```bash
npm test #ensure unit tests pass

npm run build #build client-side scripts

npm publish #push npm version
#bump bower
git tag -a v2.x.x -m "tag bower release"
git push origin master --tags
```

####Todo:
* co-reference resolution (he/she/its). ```pronoun.reference(), noun.references()```
* caching by sentence, so unchanged-sentences aren't re-parsed on keystroke
* somehow integrate the bigger, looser tests with the unit tests, to better catch regressions
* more advanced negation, sentence.is_negative() - or sentence.make_positive() .. or sentence.is_contrary(s2)?
* speedup work, some kind of speed-profile (where are the slowest parts?) Throw a novel or two in and see what bottlenecks. Some knowledge of parse speed of library in browser.
* some kind of thorough memory-leak test. Setting values to JSON objects is pass-by-reference. With lexicon, various verb lists, there is bound to be some pointers being set, which would appear with concurrency-testing.
* some kind of more specific auto-documentation for each public method. Something better than a readme. Basic human-explanations of ideas + assumptions.
* some smaller and more specific subset builds from grunt.
* perfect 'have walked' & pluperfect 'had walked' & future perfect 'will have walked' support
* habitual aspect support 'used to walk'
* consult [Ryan Schuft's influction library](https://github.com/dariusk/cyberfiction/blob/master/lib/inflection.js)
